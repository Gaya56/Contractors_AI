Target
We’re building a unified, privacy-conscious AI assistant tailored for oil/gas trade workers like pipefitters and machine repairs contractor small companies by combining multiple intelligent agents—such as web scraping, research, data analysis, visualization, email, and spreadsheet tools—into a single system with shared memory. Using the open-source repository https://github.com/Shubhamsaboo/awesome-llm-apps as our foundation, we’re selectively identifying and integrating only those components that support local execution and data privacy. The goal is to create a powerful assistant that can handle everything from performance tracking and maintenance forecasting to safety compliance, scheduling, invoicing, and communication—streamlining operations while keeping sensitive business data secure.
🛠️ Starter AI Agents (Task-Specific Tools)
These single-purpose agents help with stand-alone tasks like analysis or web research. They do not retain long-term memory (each query is handled independently
3), and most can run using local models or services. They’ll serve as the building blocks for scheduling, tracking, and other functions:
•	📁 starter_ai_agents/ai_data_analysis_agent
🧠 Memory Support: No – this agent does not store context between uses (it answers each query based only on the provided data).
🔒 Local/Private: Yes – by design it can work with local data and supports using open-source models (the repo notes many agents work with local LLMs like Llama
4
).
🛠️ Functionality: Analyzes datasets (CSV, Excel) and provides insights
4
. It can convert natural language questions into SQL, run stats or create charts on the fly. For example, it might compute average downtime from a maintenance log or generate a bar chart of monthly pipe failures.
✅ Relevance: Great for maintenance tracking and performance metrics. Contractors can drop in an equipment log or cost spreadsheet and ask in plain English, “Which machinery had the most repairs last year?” to get instant answers. This saves time on data crunching and helps in safety compliance (e.g. spotting anomaly trends in incident records).
•	📁 starter_ai_agents/xai_finance_agent
🧠 Memory Support: No – processes each financial query independently (no cumulative learning of financial history).
🔒 Local/Private: No (Cloud-dependent) – it uses the xAI’s Grok model via API
4
, meaning it sends data to an external service. (We could modify it to use a local model, but out-of-the-box it’s cloud-only.)
🛠️ Functionality: Specialized in financial data analysis
4
. It can interpret ledgers, budgets, or invoices, answering questions or producing summaries/visualizations about financial health. Think of it as an AI financial advisor that can explain numbers.
✅ Relevance: Useful for invoicing and cost control. For instance, you can feed it your job expense sheet and ask “Which project had the highest overtime costs?” However, since it’s not private by default, we might replace this with the Data Analysis Agent applied to financial data, to ensure no confidential billing info leaves our environment.
•	📁 starter_ai_agents/openai_research_agent
🧠 Memory Support: No – it doesn’t retain past queries (each research task is separate).
🔒 Local/Private: Partial – it needs internet access for web searches, and by default uses OpenAI’s API for reasoning (cloud)
2
2
. However, we could point it to a local LLM if needed. All retrieved web content can be processed locally if using a local model.
🛠️ Functionality: Acts as a web research assistant
4
. It autonomously searches online and compiles answers with references. For example, it can look up “latest OSHA regulations for welding fumes” and return a summary with source links.
✅ Relevance: Helps with safety compliance and technical queries. A contractor can use it to quickly find product datasheets, code requirements, or troubleshooting guides from forums. It automates the Googling process, ensuring decisions (like choosing a pipe epoxy or safety gear) are informed by up-to-date info. We will ensure any usage respects privacy by not sharing proprietary data in queries.
•	📁 starter_ai_agents/web_scrapping_ai_agent (Web Scraping Agent)
🧠 Memory Support: No – it doesn’t accumulate knowledge; it just fetches data when asked.
🔒 Local/Private: Yes – this agent can run locally using Python to scrape websites
1
. You control where it connects (e.g., internal sites or public info), and no external AI service is needed for the scraping itself.
🛠️ Functionality: Extracts information from websites automatically
4
. Give it a URL or query, and it will retrieve relevant content (pages, tables, etc.). It’s useful for pulling data from both public sites and private web-based dashboards (if credentials are provided).
✅ Relevance: Supports operational efficiency by automating data collection. For example, it could scrape a supplier’s site for material prices weekly, or gather weather forecasts from a meteorological site to help schedule outdoor work. It can also log into an internal maintenance portal to retrieve the latest job orders. This saves manual checking time and ensures the assistant has the latest info (e.g. scheduling can incorporate freshly scraped delivery timelines).
💬 Conversational Data Assistants (Chat-with-X Tools)
These projects provide a chatbot interface to interact with specific data sources (emails, documents, etc.). They use Retrieval Augmented Generation – meaning they fetch relevant pieces of data and then have the LLM answer your question. They do not have persistent memory beyond the current session (each session’s context is temporary)
3
. Importantly, they support local models for privacy when noted:
•	📁 chat_with_X_tutorials/chat_with_gmail
🧠 Memory Support: No – it treats each email thread or query independently (apart from threading within a single conversation). No long-term retention of past email discussions.
🔒 Local/Private: No – currently requires OpenAI GPT for the AI analysis
2
. It connects to Gmail via API to fetch message data, then sends those to GPT-4 for summarization or Q&A. There isn’t a local LLM option in the provided code (it’s listed as GPT-only)
2
.
🛠️ Functionality: A conversational email assistant. It lets you query your email account in natural language – e.g. “Show me all unread emails from my manager regarding safety inspections”. It can summarize long email threads or draft replies based on context. Essentially, it brings an AI chat experience to your inbox.
✅ Relevance: Streamlines email handling for busy contractors. Instead of manually sifting through hundreds of messages, you can ask, “Do I have any urgent messages about the pipeline repair?”, and get a quick summary. It helps ensure important communications (like a client approving a change order, or a supplier sending an invoice) aren’t missed. Privacy note: To keep sensitive emails in-house, we’d explore modifying this tool to use a local model (perhaps one of the open LLMs) even if slightly less accurate – a trade-off for confidentiality.
•	📁 chat_with_X_tutorials/chat_with_pdf
🧠 Memory Support: No – it doesn’t remember interactions once reset; context is only maintained during a single Q&A session with the loaded PDFs.
🔒 Local/Private: Yes – this supports running on local models like Llama 3, not just OpenAI
2
. It reads PDF files and converts them to embeddings for retrieval, all of which can be done offline with an open-source vector database and model.
🛠️ Functionality: Chatbot for PDF documents. You can upload one or multiple PDFs (equipment manuals, safety guidelines, contracts, blueprints) and ask questions about their content. The agent will find relevant sections and answer in plain language, often citing the document. For example, “What’s the maximum pressure rating specified in the valve manual?” would return the exact figure from the PDF.
✅ Relevance: Extremely useful for safety compliance and reference checks. Oil/gas field staff deal with extensive documentation – this tool means they no longer need to flip through binders or PDFs page by page. The assistant can instantly pull up the right information (say, a torque spec or a regulation clause). Because it can run fully offline, even proprietary documents (maintenance SOPs, client blueprints) can be queried securely, improving operational efficiency and accuracy on the job.
•	📁 chat_with_X_tutorials/chat_with_research_papers (ArXiv papers)
🧠 Memory Support: No – each interactive session stands alone; it doesn’t retain info about papers or user queries long-term.
🔒 Local/Private: Yes – like the PDF chat, it supports using local models (Llama 3) for all analysis
2
. It will need internet to fetch a paper from ArXiv if you give it just a reference, but you can also download a PDF yourself and use it offline. All parsing and question-answering can happen locally.
🛠️ Functionality: Chatbot for academic papers. Give it a research paper (especially from ArXiv’s database) and ask anything about it: “Summarize the findings of this study”, or “What experiment setup did they use?”. It will read the paper (using an internal PDF parser similar to the above) and let you have a dialogue about the methods, results, and conclusions.
✅ Relevance: Helps the contractor stay innovative and informed. While not an everyday tool, it can digest technical research relevant to oil and gas – for example, a new paper on pipeline corrosion prevention or an engineering study on pump efficiency. The assistant can summarize and explain complex research, which a small contractor might not have time to read themselves. This enables better decision-making (adopting proven techniques from latest research) without compromising privacy or spending hours reading dense academia.
💾 Memory-Enabled LLM Apps (Persistent Context)
These applications are designed with long-term memory. They can retain information across sessions – whether it’s remembering past conversations, user preferences, or a shared knowledge base. All of these are built to work with local storage and models to keep data private
3
3
. They will give the assistant continuity and personalization, acting as the “brain” that ties the whole system together.
•	📁 llm_apps_with_memory_tutorials/llm_app_with_personalized_memory
🧠 Memory Support: Yes – personalized memory for the user is this app’s core feature
3
. It creates and updates a profile of the user over time (stored in a local database or file). This includes preferences, frequently mentioned entities, and prior interactions.
🔒 Local/Private: Yes – the memory is stored locally (e.g., using a SQLite or a small vector store on disk), and the LLM can be an open-source model. No data needs to leave your machine for this to work.
🛠️ Functionality: A chatbot that learns about the user and context to give more tailored responses. For example, it might note that the user usually works on tank maintenance and prefers metric units. Next time, it will answer a question with those assumptions (like giving dimensions in meters, or recalling past tank projects when asked about “latest inspection”). It can also proactively remind or clarify based on past info: “You mentioned last week that valve #5 was acting up – do you want to review that?”.
✅ Relevance: Brings personal assistant-level service to the contractor. Over days and weeks, it will start to remember the contractor’s jobs, clients, recurring issues, and even habits. This means less repetition – the contractor doesn’t have to re-explain their situation each time. It improves scheduling (knowing typical work hours or regular appointments), safety compliance (reminding about monthly safety drills the user tends to forget), and generally makes the assistant’s help feel much more “aware” of the business’s context.
•	📁 llm_apps_with_memory_tutorials/local_chatgpt_clone_with_memory
🧠 Memory Support: Yes – it maintains conversation history persistently
3
3
. Unlike normal ChatGPT which forgets when a new chat starts, this clone can recall past dialogues even after a restart, because it saves the interactions (possibly in a local file or database).
🔒 Local/Private: Yes – this is a fully **self-hosted ChatGPT-like app】
3
. It uses open-source models (like a Llama 3.1 variant) to generate answers, so no OpenAI or external API is involved. All the AI processing and memory storage happen on the user’s own machine or server.
🛠️ Functionality: A general-purpose AI assistant you can talk to, similar to ChatGPT, but running locally with memory. You can ask it anything from troubleshooting advice to generating an email draft, and it will utilize previous conversation context as needed. For instance, if yesterday you asked it about welding rod types and today you follow up with “What was the one you said is best for cold weather?”, it remembers that context and answers accordingly.
✅ Relevance: This is the heart of the AI assistant. It can integrate all other tools: e.g., you might converse, “Find out why the compressor tripped,” and it can internally use the data analysis agent or search agent, then continue the dialogue. Its memory means a contractor can have an ongoing “chat” that spans an entire project – referring back to things discussed days or weeks prior. This is great for maintenance tracking (the chat itself becomes a log of issues and resolutions) and for planning (it can remind, “You planned to order parts last time we spoke, have you done that?”). And since it’s local, even confidential project discussions remain private.
•	📁 llm_apps_with_memory_tutorials/multi_llm_application_with_shared_memory
🧠 Memory Support: Yes – implements a shared memory store for multiple agents
3
3
. It’s like a central knowledge hub (could be a vector database or a key-value store) that all sub-agents read from and write to. This memory persists and accumulates information from all agents’ activities.
🔒 Local/Private: Yes – the whole multi-agent system can run locally. The shared memory could be a local database (e.g., Chroma or FAISS vector DB), and each LLM agent can be a local model. No external services are required for the agents to communicate or remember info.
🛠️ Functionality: A coordinated team of LLM agents with different specialties, working together and sharing one memory. For example, one agent handles data analysis, another handles scheduling, and another handles email summarization. If the analysis agent finds that “Pump A needs maintenance in 5 days” and logs that in the memory, the scheduling agent can automatically pick it up and include it in the calendar. This project shows how to synchronize agents so the “assistant” behaves like one coherent entity rather than isolated parts.
✅ Relevance: This is essentially the blueprint for our unified assistant. Oil/gas contractors juggle many tasks – this system ensures nothing falls through the cracks between different AI modules. The shared memory means the assistant can combine insights: e.g., using performance data (from the analysis agent) to inform maintenance scheduling tasks, or using an email from a client to adjust a project plan. It directly contributes to general operational efficiency by having all parts of the AI be on the same page. In practice, this could prevent miscommunications – for instance, if the user asks the finance agent about budget, and later asks the scheduler to plan jobs, the scheduler already “knows” the budget constraints because that info is in the common memory.
