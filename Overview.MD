**Our Goal:** Build a local, **privacy-first AI assistant** that combines multiple specialized LLM agents into one system for oil/gas field tasks. The assistant will handle scheduling, maintenance tracking, safety compliance, invoicing, email management, and performance analysis **without cloud services**. We’ll integrate open-source LLM tools (for web scraping, data analysis, email/PDF Q&A, etc.) and give them a **shared memory** so they can collaborate and remember important info (like maintenance needs influencing the schedule).

### Integration Checklist

- **Clone Key Modules:** Download the repository and **clone the needed directories**:  
  - `starter_ai_agents/web_scrapping_ai_agent` (web scraping)  
  - `starter_ai_agents/openai_research_agent` (web search/research)  
  - `starter_ai_agents/ai_data_analysis_agent` (data/spreadsheet analysis)  
  - `chat_with_X_tutorials/chat_with_gmail` (email assistant)  
  - `chat_with_X_tutorials/chat_with_pdf` (PDF document Q&A)  
  - `chat_with_X_tutorials/chat_with_research_papers` (for technical papers)  
  - `llm_apps_with_memory_tutorials/llm_app_with_personalized_memory` (user profile memory)  
  - `llm_apps_with_memory_tutorials/local_chatgpt_clone_with_memory` (main chat interface)  
  - `llm_apps_with_memory_tutorials/multi_llm_application_with_shared_memory` (multi-agent orchestrator)  

- **Install Dependencies:** Set up a Python environment and `pip install -r requirements.txt` for each cloned module. Ensure you have the appropriate local models (e.g. Llama) downloaded for offline use.

- **Configure Local Models:** Adjust each agent’s settings to use **local LLMs** instead of any OpenAI API. (For example, point the Gmail and PDF chat agents to a Llama model so no data leaves your machine.)

- **Set Up Shared Memory:** Choose a local **vector database** (e.g. Chroma or FAISS) or a simple key-value store. Initialize it as a common memory hub that all agents can access. This will store embeddings or notes that agents share (e.g., analysis results, detected issues).

- **Integrate Agents with Memory:** Modify each agent’s code to **write important outputs to the memory** and **read from memory** when needed:  
  - E.g., After the Data Analysis Agent identifies a faulty machine, have it add a memory entry “Machine X needs repair”.  
  - When the Scheduling Agent runs, make it query memory for “maintenance needs” so it can schedule downtime for Machine X.  

- **Orchestrator Logic:** Use the multi-agent framework to coordinate agent calls. Implement logic in the Local ChatGPT Clone (or a custom orchestrator) to route user requests to the right agent and merge results:  
  - For a “what’s our schedule?” query, call the Scheduling agent (which uses memory);  
  - For “analyze this data”, use the Analysis agent then summarize;  
  - For “summarize this email”, use the Gmail agent, etc.

- **Test End-to-End:** Run a few scenarios to ensure everything works together:  
  1. **Data → Schedule:** Feed in a maintenance log, then ask the assistant to schedule repairs. Confirm the analysis agent’s findings influence the schedule via shared memory.  
  2. **Email → Action:** Ingest a simulation of an urgent email (via Gmail agent) and see if the assistant reminds you to act (via Personalized Memory or ChatGPT Clone memory on next query).  
  3. **PDF Q&A:** Load a safety manual PDF and ask a question to verify the PDF agent responds and no cloud usage occurs.

- **Refine & Document:** Note any integration issues and adjust. Update agent prompts or memory schemas if certain info isn’t being shared or retrieved correctly. Once the system is running smoothly, document how each component interacts for future reference.
