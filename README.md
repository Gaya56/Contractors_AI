# Integration Plan for Contractor’s AI Assistant (README)

This guide outlines how to assemble a **privacy-conscious AI assistant** for oil/gas trade workers using components from the `Shubhamsaboo/awesome-llm-apps` repo. We focus on combining multiple local LLM-based agents with a **shared memory** so they can collaborate (e.g., an analysis agent writes a finding that a scheduling agent later uses).

## Selected Components to Clone

From the repository, we will use the following subfolders (agents/apps) that meet our needs and privacy requirements:

- **`starter_ai_agents/web_scrapping_ai_agent/`** – *Web Scraping Agent*: Automatically extracts info from websites (for gathering supplier prices, weather data, etc.).  
- **`starter_ai_agents/openai_research_agent/`** – *Research Agent*: Performs web searches and compiles answers (for finding regulations or manuals).  
- **`starter_ai_agents/ai_data_analysis_agent/`** – *Data Analysis Agent*: Analyzes datasets (CSVs, spreadsheets) and answers questions or produces summaries (for maintenance logs, cost spreadsheets). *(Also covers “spreadsheet agent” functionality; it can handle data in files.)*  
- **`chat_with_X_tutorials/chat_with_gmail/`** – *Email (Gmail) Chat Agent*: Allows querying and summarizing email content via natural language (for managing communications and work orders).  
- **`chat_with_X_tutorials/chat_with_pdf/`** – *PDF Chat Agent*: Enables Q&A over PDF documents (for equipment manuals, safety guidelines).  
- **`chat_with_X_tutorials/chat_with_research_papers/`** – *Research Paper Chat Agent*: Similar to PDF agent, specialized for scientific papers (for leveraging new research, if needed).  
- **`llm_apps_with_memory_tutorials/llm_app_with_personalized_memory/`** – *Personalized Memory App*: Chatbot that builds a local profile of the user and retains info across sessions (for remembering user preferences, recurring job details).  
- **`llm_apps_with_memory_tutorials/local_chatgpt_clone_with_memory/`** – *Local ChatGPT Clone*: Main conversational assistant running entirely offline, with conversation history memory (this will be the user interface to talk to).  
- **`llm_apps_with_memory_tutorials/multi_llm_application_with_shared_memory/`** – *Multi-LLM Shared Memory Framework*: Template for coordinating multiple agents with a common memory store (we will extend this to integrate the above agents together).

*Excluded modules:* We are **not** using cloud-dependent or irrelevant apps (e.g., Travel Agent with Memory, Substack/YouTube chat, etc.). All chosen tools can run with local models to avoid sending data externally.

## Architecture Overview

Our assistant will consist of **several specialized agents** (as listed) working in tandem. A central *orchestrator* (based on the Multi-LLM Shared Memory app) will manage agent interactions. Key design points:

- **Local LLMs:** Configure each agent to use offline models (e.g., Llama 3.1) instead of any default OpenAI API, to ensure privacy.  
- **Shared Memory:** Set up a **vector database** (like **Chroma** or **FAISS**) as a shared memory. This will store embeddings of important information and allow all agents to retrieve context. For example, if the Data Analysis Agent finds that *“Machine X needs maintenance on 5/10”*, it can save that as a memory entry. Later, the scheduling or chat agent can query the memory for “maintenance needs” and find that note.  
- **Agent Collaboration:** Agents will communicate implicitly through this memory. The Local ChatGPT Clone acts as the user-facing assistant; when a user asks something, it can decide (via the orchestrator logic) which specialist agent to invoke, and then incorporate that agent’s results (fetched from memory) into its response. This design keeps each agent modular while enabling complex, multi-step assistance (like data analysis → result → use result in conversation or scheduling).

## Integration Steps (Checklist)

- **[ ] Clone the repository** and install necessary dependencies (each subfolder has its own `requirements.txt`; it may be easiest to combine them into one environment).  
- **[ ] Review each selected component** to understand its usage. Update configurations to use local models (for example, the Gmail agent and others might default to GPT-4; change them to use Llama via HuggingFace or API if possible). Remove any API keys or cloud endpoints to prevent external calls.  
- **[ ] Set up Shared Memory:** Choose and initialize a local vector store:  
  - **Option A: FAISS** – a lightweight library for similarity search. Initialize an index (e.g., `faiss.IndexFlatIP`) and use it to store and query text embeddings.  
  - **Option B: ChromaDB** – an easy-to-use local vector DB with a simple `.add()` and `.query()` interface. It persists data to disk and offers filtering.  
  Create a memory instance (either in a separate module or within the orchestrator) that all agents can access.  
- **[ ] Implement Memory Read/Write in Agents:** For each agent:  
  - **After it generates an output or finds something important**, write a summary/embedding of that info to the shared memory. (e.g., in the Data Analysis agent’s code, after computing results, call something like `memory.add("maintenance_recommendation", text=result_summary)`.)  
  - **Before or during agent execution**, allow the agent to query memory for relevant context. For instance, the research agent could check memory if a similar query was answered before, or the email agent could log summaries of processed emails for future reference.  
- **[ ] Orchestration Logic:** Using the Multi-LLM Shared Memory app as a foundation, integrate the agents:  
  - Define how tasks are delegated. For example, the orchestrator (or the Local ChatGPT Clone agent) might parse user requests: if it’s a request about numbers or data, call the Data Analysis agent; if it’s asking to find information, call the Web Scraper or Research agent; if it’s about a PDF content, call the PDF agent; etc.  
  - Ensure that after an agent finishes, the orchestrator can fetch the results from memory and pass it back to the conversation flow. (The multi-agent framework likely provides a way to call one agent then feed its output to another – leverage that.)  
  - Maintain a **message or state context**: The Personalized Memory module can keep track of the user’s profile and the conversation so far. Connect this with the conversation agent so that the dialogue is aware of past interactions (this might already be handled by the Local ChatGPT clone’s memory feature). 
- **[ ] Testing Multi-Agent Flows:** Validate that the system works end-to-end in a few scenarios:  
  - *Data Analysis → Conversation:* Input a sample spreadsheet (e.g., equipment runtimes) to the analysis agent through the conversation interface (“Analyze this sheet for any anomalies”). Verify the analysis agent writes a finding to memory and the chat agent picks it up and tells the user the insights.  
  - *Web Search → PDF → Answer:* Ask the assistant a question that requires multiple steps (e.g., “Find the installation procedure for Valve Y and explain steps”). The orchestrator should use the Research Agent (to find a relevant manual PDF perhaps), use the PDF Agent to extract steps, then have the ChatGPT clone present the answer. Check that relevant pieces were stored in memory (like the PDF text snippets) and reused correctly.  
  - *Email → Data Analysis → Scheduling:* Simulate an email arriving about an equipment fault. Use the Gmail agent to summarize it, store that summary in memory tagged “urgent issue”. Run the analysis agent on recent sensor data, store output. Then ask the assistant, “When can we schedule maintenance for the flagged issues?” and see if it retrieves the “urgent issue” and analysis info from memory to produce a schedule suggestion.

- **[ ] Iterate and Refine:** As you test, you might need to adjust what each agent writes to memory (too little vs too much detail) and how the orchestrator decides to invoke agents. Fine-tune the prompts and conditions for best results. Ensure that all interactions remain local – double-check no calls to external APIs are happening (unless explicitly intended for web search).  

## Notes

- **Memory Management:** Consider setting a size limit or relevance filter for the vector memory (especially if running long-term, to avoid indefinite growth). The Personalized Memory app likely outlines strategies for keeping memory useful, such as summarizing older entries.  
- **Security:** Running everything locally means data stays private, but ensure any external web scraping or research is done on non-confidential queries. For extremely sensitive data (like proprietary PDFs), the PDF agent usage is safe offline; just avoid sending such data out via the research agent by mistake.  
- **Customization:** Our chosen modules cover core needs (analysis, info retrieval, communication). You can later add others (e.g., a voice interface from `voice_ai_agents/` if hands-free operation is needed in the field) following the same integration pattern.

With this setup completed, you’ll have an AI assistant that can **search, analyze, remember, and advise** – all while keeping your data on-premise. Use this README as a living checklist throughout development, and adjust as needed to fit the specific workflows of the team. Good luck building your assistant!
